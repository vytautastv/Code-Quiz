# Javascript Code Quiz
This repo will be used to complete the week 6 bootcamp challenge - Javascript Code Quiz

## Description 
The purpose of this challenge was to utilise the skills we learned in this weeks bootcamp by creating a code quiz app from using Javscript following a set of acceptance criteria.

The motivation for this project was to take all the key learning in the 6th week of lessons and put them to use in a real world scenario by building a javscript code quiz app that will be shared on my digital CV.

The project was built to consolidate knowledge and usage of Javscript best practices. It was also used to design a completed app, with numerous prompts, and validations.

This project solves key problems such as making the App function in a way that takes in user inputs and suggests if the chosen answer is correct or not. The more correct answers are chosen, the higher the end score of the user will be. Final scores will be tracked in local storage and can be cleared using a button.

Key learnings: 

1. Using Javscript functions, Objects and Arrays, validations
2. How to use basic git commands such as add, commit and push to save changes in a repository such as Github
3. Use event listeners to make something happen when a button is clicked by a user
4. DOM manipulation
5. Saving user input to local storage

## Acceptance Criteria

Here is a list of criteria that has to be met to pass the challenge: 
Your application must:

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score
